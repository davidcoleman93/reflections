When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  You would want to use a remote repository if multiple people were contributing (and commiting) to the project.
  Same goes for multiple devices. Lastly if you simply wanted viewable online or to have a backup of your git/project online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because if changes on GitHub could affect or break what you are currently working on, or even completed features, then you may want to
	wait to an appropiate logical stage to update. This could be fairly common if multiple people are updating the GitHub repository.
