What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates a .git file. You need to do this to track the history of changes to the files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It acts as a mid-point to allow you to set what files you want to be tracked as changes and commits are made.
